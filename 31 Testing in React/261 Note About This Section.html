If you are new to testing, then you can watch all of the videos. If you know about testing and only want to focus on React specific testing, you can start from halfway at the lesson titled <strong><em>Note: Testing React Apps </em></strong>and watch from there. If you already know everything about testing and you just want to see how tests are implemented in our Master Project, go straight to <strong>Testing In Our Master Project!</strong><br><br>Enjoy :)</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
