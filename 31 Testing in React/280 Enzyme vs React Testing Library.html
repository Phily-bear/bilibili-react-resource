An alternative to Enzyme is <a href="https://testing-library.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">React Testing Library</a>. They are both very similar in what they do, so if you learn one, it is very easy to use the other as you can see <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/migrate-from-enzyme/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>If you are using Enzyme with React 17 you may encounter some issues since as of now, they are working on the official update for <a href="https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/pull/2430" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enzyme React 17 adapter</a>. This should be added to the library in a few days. For now you can use this alternative <em>(a simple google search of "Enzyme adapter for React 17" would have revealed this to you)</em>: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64658031/which-enzyme-adapter-works-with-react-17" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64658031/which-enzyme-adapter-works-with-react-17</a><br><br>You will learn more about how to use this in the next video!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
